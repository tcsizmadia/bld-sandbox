# Dog Names Service for Bld Demonstration

Dog Names Service is a Spring Boot application that provides information about different dog breeds and a sample set of dog names for new pet owners. 
The intention behind this service is solely to be a subject for demonstrating [Bld](https://github.com/rife2/bld) - a pure Java-based build tool - in action.

## Introduction

This project is a simple Spring Boot application that serves information about various dog breeds and names. It reads breed data from a CSV file and provides endpoints to retrieve this information.

## Features

- List all dog breeds
- Fall back to a default set of breeds if the CSV file is not found
- Build is powered by Bld from [RIFE2](https://rife2.com)
- Using Bld, it is possible to provide a more diverse set of breeds generated by a local LLM through [Ollama](https://ollama.com)

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tcsizmadia/bld-sandbox.git
    cd bld-sandbox/backend
    ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
    ```sh
    ./bld download compile
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    ./bld run
    ```

### OPTIONAL: Generate list of dog breeds using Generative AI:

The REST API should work without the custom `dog-breeds.csv` file. This feature was added to demonstrate how to create a [Custom Command](https://github.com/rife2/bld/wiki/Custom-Commands) 
in Bld projects. Feel free to skip this part, if you are not interested in custom commands or LLMs.

1. Download Ollama from the [official website](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Pull the [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) model: 

   ```sh
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```
3. Start Ollama (you can use the UI instead of running it from the Terminal):
   ```sh
   ollama serve
   ```
4. Generate the `dog-breeds.csv` file:
   ```sh
   ./bld genereate-breeds
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

## API Endpoints

Example:
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/dogs/breeds
```
